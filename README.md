Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree: Musical Structure App project.

This app was born as an exercise, but I took it a bit too seriously. My intention is to build an app for a friend of mine, Marco, who writes music ( see http://www.marcomantovani.name to know more about him). I built the structure following exercise instruction, and tried to link Marco's work on the website. 
Learning on, I hope I will be able to make this a perfectly working app.
